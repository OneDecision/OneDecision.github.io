      <h1>Decision Management Solutions and Trisotech join OneDecision.io consortium</h1>
      <h3>London / Montreal / Palo Alto</h3>

      <p>OneDecision.io, the open industry initiative launched in July 2015, today announced the addition of two additional key industry players to the  consortium, Decision Management Solutions and Trisotech. This now brings to six the number of supporters of this innovative open software initiative. OpenDecision.io was formed to promote the Decision Model & Notation (DMN) standard, published by the Object Management Group (OMG), by providing an open source reference implementation for automatic execution of DMN models.

     <p>Decision Management is a rigorous approach to understanding an organization’s performance and driving improvements. With the increased digitization of customer interactions new standards and tools are needed to create both automated and yet personalized decision making. 

     <p>OMG released the first version of DMN as an open standard in December 2014 and a follow up is under development that builds on and clarifies the earlier work. All members of the OneDecision.io consortium are actively engaged in this process. On a high level, DMN describes decision requirements and dependencies. Below that, DMN allows definition of decision logic, which can be exchanged between stakeholders and executed by a rules engine. 

     <p>The newly created project OneDecision.io provides an Open Source, Java-based reference implementation for DMN execution. It supports basic decision tables, JSON data types, and the standardized DMN XML interchange format. The project is published under an Apache license, enabling open access to the source code for commercial and non-commercial purposes.

     <p>Tim Stephenson, co-Founder of Omny Link and initial OneDecision.io implementation author, is thrilled to see the momentum continuing to build around the DMN standard and OneDecision.io as a means to deliver native DMN support within larger software applications.

     <p>Denis Gagné, CEO of Trisotech, states “DMN is to Decision Management what BPMN is to Process Management and CMMN is to Case Management, a catalyst to better defining the operations of an organization.”

      <p>“Decision modeling with DMN is helping our clients transform their businesses to be more agile, analytic and adaptive. The OneDecision.io initiative will speed the adoption of this important new technique, critical to the successful adoption of advanced analytics,” said James Taylor, CEO of Decision Management Solutions.

     <p>The OneDecision.io project is now supported by Alfresco, Bruce Silver Associates, Decision Management Solutions, Omny Link, Signavio and Trisotech. The open source project, including source code download, can be found at http://onedecision.io.
